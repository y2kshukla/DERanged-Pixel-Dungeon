# DERanged Pixel Dungeon
**DERanged Pixel Dungeon** is a little bit silly version of [ReARranged Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/Hoto-Mocha/Re-ARranged-Pixel-Dungeon), which is the reworked version of [ARranged Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/Hoto-Mocha/ARranged-Pixel-Dungeon), which is basically an extended version of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon) by [Evan Debenham](https://github.com/00-Evan) , with content borrowed from [Rat King Adventure](https://github.com/TrashboxBobylev/Rat-King-Adventure), which is expansive fork of [RKPD2](https://github.com/Zrp200/rkpd2/releases), which is forked from the [source code of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon/) by [00-Evan](https://shatteredpixel.com/), inspired by Rat King Dungeon by the same author. Yeah, that's a lot of heritage for such fun game.

ReARranged game fully supports Korean language basically. This game's content doesn't. English language is supported too, which is translated by ChatGPT, with additional content and Archer strings being written in English by me, TrashboxBobylev.

Started community-based translation on [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/rearranged-pixel-dungeon/rearranged-pixel-dungeon/), please consider joining translation work if you are interested.

## Download (Windows)
Ready-to-play, self-contained Windows builds of this fork are built and tested automatically by the
[Build Windows EXE](.github/workflows/build-windows-exe.yml) workflow and published to the
[**Windows build release**](https://github.com/y2kshukla/DERanged-Pixel-Dungeon/releases/tag/windows-exe-1.2.0).
Java does not need to be installed, it is bundled with the game:

* **Installer:** [DERangedPixelDungeon-1.2.0-Windows-x64.exe](https://github.com/y2kshukla/DERanged-Pixel-Dungeon/releases/download/windows-exe-1.2.0/DERangedPixelDungeon-1.2.0-Windows-x64.exe)
  - run it, then start the game from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
* **Portable:** [DERangedPixelDungeon-1.2.0-Windows-x64-portable.zip](https://github.com/y2kshukla/DERanged-Pixel-Dungeon/releases/download/windows-exe-1.2.0/DERangedPixelDungeon-1.2.0-Windows-x64-portable.zip)
  - unzip it anywhere and run `DERanged Pixel Dungeon.exe`. Keep the folder together.

No graphics card is needed: if your computer cannot provide a modern OpenGL context (virtual machines,
remote desktop sessions, and machines without a graphics driver only offer the ancient OpenGL 1.1
driver that is built into Windows), the game says so and restarts itself on the software renderer it
carries, which draws everything on the CPU instead of a graphics card.

The builds are not code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may warn you the first time you start the game
("More info" -> "Run anyway"). Saves are stored in `%APPDATA%\.trashboxbobylev\DERanged Pixel Dungeon`.
